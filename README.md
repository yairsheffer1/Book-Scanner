## 📚 Project Description

This project presents a fully automated, software-only pipeline for digitizing printed books directly from handheld video recordings.

Instead of relying on specialized scanning hardware, the system processes a continuous video of page flipping and automatically produces a clean, ordered, and searchable PDF document.

### Main Features
- Fully automated end-to-end pipeline
- No dedicated scanning hardware required
- Produces OCR-enabled searchable PDFs
- Modular design enabling independent testing and extension

### Main Components
- Frame extraction and stability detection  
- Page splitting and grouping  
- Corner-based cropping  
- Masking and image enhancement  
- Geometric dewarping  
- PDF assembly and OCR  

### Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Tesseract OCR
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## ⚡ Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project locally for development and testing.

---

## 🧱 Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Tesseract OCR


---

## 🧪 Testing

This project emphasizes pipeline-level functional validation with explicit inspection
of intermediate outputs, rather than relying solely on black-box end-to-end testing.

The system is evaluated by running real capture data through the full processing
pipeline, while persisting debug artifacts for each processing stage. Each stage
produces a dedicated output directory, allowing independent verification of correctness
before progressing to the next step.

The validation workflow includes:

• Supplying a short video of a book being flipped
• Executing the full processing pipeline
• Persisting intermediate results for every major stage
• Validating each stage independently using its debug outputs
• Verifying that the final result is a clean, ordered, and searchable PDF

Pipeline Stage Validation:

**Frame Selection:**
Verifies that only stable, non-moving frames are selected as candidate pages.

**Page Splitting:**
Validates correct separation of left and right pages, using saved split images.

**Corner-Based Cropping:**
Verifies safe and consistent background reduction with no observed content loss.

**Grouping and Ordering:**
Confirms that pages are grouped and ordered correctly prior to PDF generation.

**Dewarping:**
Ensures curved pages are geometrically rectified without introducing text distortion,
by inspecting both original and cleaned dewarped outputs.

**OCR Validation:**
Evaluates extracted text accuracy by comparing OCR output against reference digital scans.

This structured, stage-by-stage validation approach enables precise debugging,
isolates failures to specific pipeline components, and ensures robustness under
realistic capture conditions.

## 🚀 Deployment

The system is designed for offline, local execution and does not require server-side deployment.

Typical deployment workflow:
1. Capture a video of page flipping using a standard smartphone.
2. Transfer the video to a local machine.
3. Run the pipeline to generate a searchable PDF.

The pipeline operates fully automatically after video capture and requires no further user interaction.
